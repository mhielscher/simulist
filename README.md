# simulist
A modeling system for the kidney transplant waiting list.

## Accuracy
An update: I received my deceased-donor kidney transplant in April, 2018!

Results from updating and running simulist over multiple years consistently gave me the bulk of the chance to receive a transplant in 2018 - >65% chance when last run at the beginning of 2018. It looks like it was accurate! (As accurate as you can be with such large-grain statistics.)
